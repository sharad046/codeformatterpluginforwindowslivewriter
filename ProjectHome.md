## Features: ##
##  ##
  * ### Uses different formatting 'engines'; in this release you get the choice of using [ActiPro's CodeHighlighter](http://www.actiprosoftware.com/products/dotnet/aspnet/codehighlighter/default.aspx) or [Alex Gorbatchev SyntaxHighlighter 2.0](http://alexgorbatchev.com/SyntaxHighlighter/) ###
  * ### Can place the output into Windows Live Writer as either HTML or Images. ###
  * ### Effects can be applied to images, such as shadows, glows, reflections etc. ###
  * ### Uses 'smart content' - which basically means that you can re-edit your code snippets, even after you've published them (e.g. highlight code and output it as HTML, then publish it, then re-load it and change it to an image and apply some image effects).  A lot of plugins aren't 'smart content'; their output is raw HTML that can't be easily edited. ###
