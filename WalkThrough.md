# Introduction #

Using the plug-in is easy.  The steps that follow take you through formatting some code and inserting it into your blog.


# Details #

## Step 1 ##
In WLW, in the `Insert` panel, click the new `Source code...` entry.  You will then see a screen like this:

## Step 2 ##
This screen shows a preview of your code and allows you to change the settings.

> If you don't see anything in the preview, it's because you had no text in your clipboard.
> Simply hit the `Edit...` button and add the code that you want formatted.

Select the `Syntax Highlighter` radio button at the top.  This sets the rendering engine used to render the highlighting and formatting. Now we're going to insert this highlighted snippet of code **as text** into our blog post.  Click the `Insert as Text` button.

Back in Windows Live Writer, hit the `Preview tab` at the bottom.  You should see something like the following screen

> Note: **actual output will vary depending on the theme of your blog.  Most of the time, SyntaxHighlighter output will _not_ display correctly in WLW - not until it's published.  See [this page](http://www.radupoenaru.com/add-syntaxhiglight-to-windows-live-writer-in-preview-mode/) for some tips on how to get around this limitation of WLW**

## Step 3 ##
In this step, we're going to change the **highlighted text** for an **image** and apply some image effects.  Switch back to the `Edit tab` and single click the code:

Click the `Edit code` button. In the screen that follows, select `Insert as image`.
You'll then see the properties screen change to this:

![http://codeformatterpluginforwindowslivewriter.googlecode.com/files/walkthough3.2.png](http://codeformatterpluginforwindowslivewriter.googlecode.com/files/walkthough3.2.png)

This screen shows the properties that are available when inserting code as an image.  It allows various effects to be added and removed.

We're now going to add a `Perspective View` effect.  From the `Actions` dropdown-menu, select `Perspective View`.  Change the Angle to something, say around 22 degrees.  Change the Orientation to `TopToBottom`.  You should have something like the following on the right hand side of WLW:

Now, add a `Glow` effect and change the colour to Red:

Now, switch back to the `Preview tab`.  You should see something like this:

![http://codeformatterpluginforwindowslivewriter.googlecode.com/files/walkthough3.5-preview.png](http://codeformatterpluginforwindowslivewriter.googlecode.com/files/walkthough3.5-preview.png)

## Step 4 ##
We've now got a nice looking code snippet with a few effects.

In this last step - we're going to modify the code and see the output image update in _near_ real-time.

Switch back to the `Edit tab` and select the code snippet by single-clicking it.  Now click the `Edit code...` button again.

The window that appears shows the preview and allows you to change the settings.
Click on the `Show line numbers` check-box.  Notice that the preview **and** the output image has changed and now shows line numbers:

We're now going to change the code.
Click the `Edit` button.
You should see an editable popup window overlay the preview.

Change the code to this:

![http://codeformatterpluginforwindowslivewriter.googlecode.com/files/walkthough4.2-changecode.png](http://codeformatterpluginforwindowslivewriter.googlecode.com/files/walkthough4.2-changecode.png)

You should see everything update.

Now just click the `Insert as Image` button again and you're finished.
